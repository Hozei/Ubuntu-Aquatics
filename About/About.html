    <h1>About Ubuntu Aquatics</h1>

    <p>The Fish and vegetable industry has had a good market price over the years because 
        of its high demand, so we plan to run as a medium scale for a year and later expand 
        to different production size. The world nowadays is in great turmoil, Financial crisis 
        seems to plunge each and every one. Aching global oil crisis, threatening nuclear 
        crisis, and sinking financial economies are such of the few that warned us that we 
        have to save and we have to be practical. </p>
        <p>Thus, in order to answer the needs of the time, we carved this idea of having a fish 
            farm business project to alleviate or even just soothe the crisis faced by most of the 
            consumers right now. We plan to raise this project, not just of aiming to have bountiful 
            gains but also to aid the masses of consumers by offering quality product guaranteed 
            with pocket-friendly price. How the Aquaponics systems will works ?! The fish are 
            raised in a tank and water from the fish tank is pumped to the plants. Bacteria convert 
            ammonia and nitrite to nitrate. Plants absorb the nutrient rich water. Filtered water is 
            returned to the fish tank, clean.</p>
